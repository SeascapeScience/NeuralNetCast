Forecasting biodiversity using neural networks

## The basic idea

 - Building/testing short-term forecasts of biodiversity data following the method described in Grasso et al. (2019) (for toxin data)
 - Uses collections of survey data that measure species abundance for many species at many sites, at regular time steps
 - Input data looks something like this:
```   | Time Step | Location | Species 1 | Species 2 | ...|
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   |1997|XYZ1|1234|37|...|
   ```
